	  <h2>Abstract</h2>
	  <p>Currently, there are many automatic and semi-automatic tools to expedite software maintenance; however, most of these tools rely solely on the structural model of the program, while disregarding any semantic information from the natural language used by the programmer. In previous work towards solving this problem, we develepod a Software Word Usage Model (SWUM) for Java. SWUM enables software engineering tools to apply linguistic relations between words to form a more complete interpretation of the program. Although SWUM is currently defined for Java, we believe that SWUM is capable of representing programs in different programming languages. This project focuses on investigating the generality and extensibility of SWUM for programming languages beyond Java. The potential structural, semantic, and syntactic modications of SWUM for other languages were examined, particularly analyzing the differences between Java and C++. We evaluated the effectiveness of the phrases generated from SWUM for C++ code, and modified the SWUM construction algorithm to handle C++ features as needed.</p>
