This summer, I'll be working at the <a href="http://udel.edu" target="_blank">University of Delaware</a> in the <a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~hiper/" target="_blank">HiperSpace</a> lab. Specifically, I'll be working on their Natural Language Program Analysis (NLPA) project. Here, you can get to know <a href="people.php">me and the people</a> I'm working with, learn about the <a href=project.php>research</a> I'm doing, and read a <a href="journal.php">journal</a> documenting my work. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to <a href="people.php#sana">contact me</a>!</p></div>

			<div class="text"><p>If you're interested in pursuing graduate school or having a career in research, <a href="http://cra-w.org/dmp" target="_blank">DREU</a> is a great way to get started. I'm not very good at describing things, so here is an excerpt from the DREU website!</p>
				<blockquote cite="http://cra-w.org/dmp">Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU) was known as the Distributed Mentor Project (DMP) prior to 2009. The objective of the DREU is to increase the number of women and underrepresented groups entering graduate studies in the fields of computer science and engineering. This highly selective program matches promising undergraduate women and underrepresented groups with a faculty mentor for a summer research experience at the faculty member's home institution. Students are directly involved in a research project and interact with graduate students and professors on a daily basis. This experience is invaluable for students who are considering graduate school, providing them with a close-up view of what graduate school is really like and also increasing their competitiveness as an applicant for graduate admissions and fellowships.</blockquote></div>
